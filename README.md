# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction System

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn using machine learning classification models. It helps businesses proactively retain customers by identifying key churn drivers and high-risk users. The system includes end-to-end steps from data cleaning to model deployment and visualization using Power BI.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn probability, identify key factors influencing churn, and present actionable business insights through a dashboard.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Google Colab)
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, model training
- **XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression** – ML algorithms
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Power BI** – Final dashboard presentation
- **Streamlit** (optional attempt)

## 📤 Output Files

| File                      | Description                            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `final_df.csv`            | Cleaned and encoded dataset            |
| `feature_importance.csv`  | Top churn-driving features             |
| `top_risk_customers.csv`  | Customers with highest churn probability |
| `customer_churn.pbix`     | Power BI dashboard                     |

---

## 💼 Business Recommendations

- Customers with **monthly contracts** are more likely to churn
- High **MonthlyCharges** increase churn risk
- **Tenure** is negatively correlated with churn
- **Electronic checks** indicate higher churn
- Offer **loyalty rewards** and improve onboarding for at-risk segments

---

## 📌 Optional Deployment

> Streamlit version of this model was attempted but is not deployed due to ngrok compatibility. Future improvement can integrate full web UI.
